# HMO
General overview:
This system is designed to manage a database of COVID-19 patients, including patient personal information and vaccination data if applicable. The system is built using modern technologies such as MongoDB for database management, React for user interface development, and Node.js for server-side and data retrieval. To enable low costs and effective code performance, external libraries such as Axios were used to make server calls, Express was used to create server APIs, and Multer was used to manage and add images to the database.

Installation:
To install the project, follow these steps:

*Install Node.js, MongoDB, and a React development environment on your computer.

*Download the system code from the Git repository and open the system libraries in your development environment.

*Open your package manager and run npm install to install all necessary packages.

*Run the command npm start to start React, and run the command node app.js to activate the database.

General Description:
When the system is launched, users can add a new patient by clicking on the "Add Patient" button and filling in the relevant patient details. To add an image for the patient, users can upload an image from their computer and add it as part of the patient's details.

All patients in the database are displayed in a table, with the table showing the patient's name, date of the last check-up, and the start and end dates of treatment for the disease.
